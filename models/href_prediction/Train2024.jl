# OKAY THIS HUGE MESS BELOW IS ME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE OLD 2020 MODELS HAD BETTER AUC
# It's because 90% of AUC is the performance at false positive rates of 10%-100%, i.e. painting
# more than 10% of the US in torprob. That's unrealistic and thus AUC only really measures the
# model performance at super high POD.
#
# Better is to use the area under the precision-recall curve.
#
# The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets

# The area under the precision-recall curve as a performance metric for rare binary events
